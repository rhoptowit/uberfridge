UberFridge is a project to turn my old fridge into a fermentation temperature controller to brew beer.

---

Features are:
  * 2 temperature sensors, one in the fermenting beer and one in the fridge.
  * PID control of the beer temperature with 0.1 °C accuracy
  * Predictive on-off control for the fridge temperature to keep it in a -0.5 to +0.5 °C range.
  * Modes of operation: constant beer temperature, constant fridge temperature or beer temperature profile
  * 4×20 character OLED display
  * Data logging on a USB stick in JSON and CSV format
  * Web interface over WiFi
  * Graphs of beer and fridge temperature history
